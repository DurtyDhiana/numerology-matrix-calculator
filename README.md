# Numerology Matrix Calculator

## What This Does

The Numerology Matrix Calculator generates and visualizes a numerological “Matrix of Destiny” from a user’s birth date. It combines classical numerological reduction with arcana-based symbolic interpretation to deliver both numerical results and visual output.

Example: Enter your birth date and the tool calculates key numerological numbers, visualizes them, and interprets the results using arcana meanings.

## Why You Might Want This

This project solves the problem of manually calculating and interpreting your numerological matrix. It provides structured output and graphics so that users interested in numerology can get insight quickly without doing hand calculations.

Example: Instead of performing multiple manual reductions and symbolic mappings, this tool automates the entire process and presents a clear visual.

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. Download: Clone the repository
2. Run: Execute `run_comprehensive_calculator.py`
3. Done: View output in generated image and console interpretation

## What You Need Before Starting

- Python 3 installed
- `matrix_interpretation.txt` data file (included)
- Libraries (if any specified in requirements)

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Get the Files

Clone or download this repository from GitHub.

### Step 2: Open the Program

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.

### Step 3: Follow the Prompts

Run the Python script and input your birth date when prompted (`DD.MM.YYYY`). The script calculates all matrix values and interpretations.

### Step 4: Find Your Results

A PNG visualization and printed arcana interpretation will appear in the console and project directory.

## How You'll Know It Worked

You should see:

✅ A generated PNG file with the matrix visualization  
✅ Console output showing arcana numbers and meanings  
✅ No errors during script execution

If you don't see these, check the troubleshooting section.

## How Long This Takes

- Setup: 1-5 minutes
- First run: ~30 seconds
- Subsequent runs: ~10 seconds each

## 🖥️ For Windows Users

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt, navigate into the project folder, and run:

python run_comprehensive_calculator.py

## 🍎 For Mac Users

Open Terminal, `cd` into the project folder, then run:

python3 run_comprehensive_calculator.py

## 📱 For Phone/Tablet Users

Mobile terminals are not supported for running Python scripts; use a desktop or laptop.

## What Each Part Does

| File/Folder Name | What It's For |
|------------------|---------------|
| `run_comprehensive_calculator.py` | Main execution script |
| `data/` | Arcana interpretation files |
| `numerology/` | Core calculators and logic |
| `Matrix_of_Destiny_*.png` | Generated visualization output |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Before You Give Up

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Confirm you are in the correct folder
3. Ensure `matrix_interpretation.txt` is present
4. Run `python` or `python3` explicitly
5. Ask for help with error messages

## Not Working? Try the Simple Version

If this full setup gives trouble, focus on running the script without visualization and reading console output only.

## Common Questions

**Q: I got an error about missing modules - what do I do?**  
A: Install required Python packages or ensure you run with correct Python version.

**Q: Can I use this on my Mac?**  
A: Yes, if Python is installed.

**Q: Is this free to use?**  
A: Yes, under the MIT license.

## If You See These Scary Messages

| Scary Message | What It Actually Means | Fix |
|---------------|----------------------|-----|
| "Module not found" | Python package missing | Install via `pip install` |
| "Permission denied" | No write access | Run in a writable folder |
| "Syntax error" | Python version mismatch | Use correct Python version |

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. Verify Python installation
2. Confirm script is in the current directory
3. Double-check input date format `DD.MM.YYYY`
4. Search for the specific error online or ask for help

## Why I Made This

This tool exists to automate the tedious process of numerology matrix calculation and interpretation through code, visualization, and structured output.

This took dedicated effort to integrate arcana interpretation with numeric calculation and visuals.
